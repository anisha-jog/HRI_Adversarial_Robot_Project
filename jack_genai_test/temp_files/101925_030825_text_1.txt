Text Output: 1. This appears to be a stylized drawing of a burning leaf or some kind of stylized flame with crossed branches underneath.
2. I propose drawing a simplified human face looking slightly to the side.
3. I will add four simple strokes to the original drawing to suggest a profile: a curved line for the forehead and nose, a small curve for the mouth, a short vertical line for the suggestion of an eye, and a slightly curved line for the chin.
4. I will now create a new drawing by copying the original and adding these strokes.Image Output: Found image with mime type image/png
