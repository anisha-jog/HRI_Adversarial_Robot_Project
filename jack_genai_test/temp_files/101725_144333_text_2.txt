Text Output: 1.  The drawing seems to depict a person outside during the day, blowing bubbles, with a potted plant nearby and the sun shining. A table lamp is also present, which seems out of place in the outdoor daytime scene.

2.  A diametrically opposite subject could be a person inside at night, reading a book by the light of a bedside lamp, with no plants visible and a moon outside the window.

3.  To make the drawing more similar to the proposed subject, I will add a simple curved line outside the lamp to suggest a window and a crescent moon.Image Output: Found image with mime type image/png
